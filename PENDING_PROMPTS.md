# Pending Prompts

This file contains Codex prompts that are waiting to be discussed and eventually implemented.

Codex may refer to `DESIGN_BIBLE.md` for project context, but this file is the active implementation queue.

Important: Do not implement any prompt from this file immediately. Every prompt must go through a design discussion first. Codex should respond with feedback, concerns, suggestions, and clarifying questions before making code changes. Implementation should only begin after the design has been discussed and I explicitly approve moving forward.

After a prompt has been fully discussed, implemented, and tested, remove that completed prompt from `PENDING_PROMPTS.md` automatically as part of cleanup for that implementation. Do not remove a prompt just because it has been discussed. Do not remove a prompt just because coding has started. Only remove it after the feature is implemented and tested.

Prototype save compatibility is not a priority unless explicitly requested. It is acceptable to break or reset old local saves while the game is still being tested only by the developer and Codex. Prefer clear code and clean forward design over preserving outdated prototype save structures.

## Current Priority Order

1. Add Map Navigation Smoke Tests
2. Black Market Byproduct Economy System

---

## 1. Add Map Navigation Smoke Tests

Add smoke tests for the larger map, camera panning, keyboard movement, mouse drag panning, and contextual map actions.

The map is becoming central enough that navigation regressions will make the whole game feel broken. Tests should verify that the map remains visible, selectable, pannable, and usable after the 100x100 expansion and contextual action updates.

This system should answer questions like:
- What should be tested through DOM/Playwright versus direct state/model tests?
- How should tests confirm the camera moves without relying on fragile pixel-perfect assertions?
- How should tests verify selection still works after panning?
- How should tests verify synthesis tube contextual actions appear?
- How should tests cover disabled command reasons?
- Should tests include hotkey conflict checks?

The desired result is a small but useful smoke suite that protects map navigation and contextual action basics.

Before coding, discuss the most valuable smoke paths, test stability concerns, and whether this prompt should be implemented after all related map-navigation prompts or alongside them.

## 2. Black Market Byproduct Economy System

Create a black market economy system focused on selling natural byproducts and other illegal biological goods.

The black market should make the lab's strange outputs economically meaningful. Natural byproducts, harvested specimen materials, corpses, preserved tissues, commissioned creatures, and services can eventually become sources of money, reputation, suspicion, and risk.

This system should begin with byproducts because Collection Bay and byproduct coherence create a natural production pipeline. The market should care about what the substance is, how rare or dangerous it is, how pure or fresh it is, how much the buyer wants it, and how risky it is to move.

The system should answer questions like:
- Who buys slime byproducts and why?
- How are prices determined?
- How do rarity, danger, purity, output quality, and demand affect value?
- How does selling affect black market reputation?
- How does selling affect Suspicion?
- How are commissions different from freeform sales?
- How does the market avoid becoming a simple "sell all" button?
- How does the UI keep deals readable and flavorful?

The black market should feel illegal, useful, and dangerous. Selling weird substances should help fund the lab, but also create evidence trails, relationships, expectations, and exposure.

The desired result is an economy foundation where byproducts and biological materials are not just stockpiles, but part of a growing illicit network that can later support commissions, reputation tiers, rare buyers, scams, raids, and story escalation.

Before coding, discuss the market model, the first sellable goods, pricing philosophy, reputation, suspicion, and how much economy depth belongs in the first implementation.
